‚öôÔ∏è WHAT HAPPENS NEXT (Live Breakdown)
üîé PHASE 1: Full SQL Injection
SQLMap runs with high intensity: --level=5 --risk=3

Dumps:

All databases

All tables

All columns

All data (--dump-all)

Gets user data: --users --passwords --roles --privileges

Outputs info>>qlmap\output\

üìÇ PHASE 2: File Read (If Allowed)
Attempts to grab:

/etc/passwd ‚Äì standard Linux file

/var/www/html/config.php ‚Äì might contain database creds

If vulnerable, it saves the file into:

lua
Copy
Edit
sqlmap\output


üí£ PHASE 3: OS Shell
If SQLMap detects it‚Äôs possible, it will:

Launch an interactive shell

Let you run Linux commands like:

bash
Copy
Edit
whoami
uname -a
ls -la /var/www
üîç PHASE 4: Sensitive Data Extraction
Scans your dumped data for:

Tokens

API keys

Passwords

EMV tags

Anything juicy

It writes this into:

Copy
Edit
extracted_findings.txt
üß† PHASE 5: Crack Hashes (Manual)
If hashes were found in Phase 1:

They're saved in the SQLMap output

You can copy them into:

Copy
Edit
hashdump.txt
Then run something like:

nginx
Copy
Edit
hashcat -m 0 hashdump.txt rockyou.txt
üóÉ WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN OUTPUT
Folder / File	What it Contains
sqlmap\output\yourdomain\dump\	Dumped database tables (CSV/SQL format)
sqlmap\output\yourdomain\files\	Any successfully read files
extracted_findings.txt	All juicy terms (tokens, passwords, secrets)
cmd window	If OS shell opened, real-time command responses

sqlmap is an open source penetration testing tool that automates the process of detecting and exploiting SQL injection flaws and taking over of database servers. It comes with a powerful detection engine, many niche features for the ultimate penetration tester, and a broad range of switches including database fingerprinting, over data fetching from the database, accessing the underlying file system, and executing commands on the operating system via out-of-band connections.
